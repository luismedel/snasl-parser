# snasl-parser

snasl-parser (for Sharp NASL Parser) is a parser for the [Nessus Attack Scripting Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_Attack_Scripting_Language) used by vulnerability scanners like Nessus and OpenVAS.

I made this parser a yer ago (I write this on june 2022) for a very specific use case, so maybe is not 100% fully compliant with the (fuzzy) official specs.

## Interpreter

I planned to also write a NASL interpreter using the AST obtained by this parser, but never found time to really plan and write it.

I think there's some residual code here.
